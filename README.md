#Write up about the project:

The process I took to code a website. First, I printed off the mock-up of the website and analyzed its patterns. I highlighted the section of the printed website. I lay out the structure of HTML and Bootstrap. Then, I place the responsive image and typography. I use Bootstrap to configure the code. I create my CSS code or use Bootstrap CSS to customize the websites.

My difficulty during the development were learning how to use Bootstrap and responsive images. I overcome the challenges of learning Bootstrap by sticking to one code language at a time. I was accustomed to using basic HTML and was mixing up my code languages, which is somewhat like Bootstrap; however, Bootstrap has template code. I generally had to translate the basic HTML code terminology to Bootstrap and reference the Bootstrap code. Bootstrap has different CSS codes, and customizing was a challenge. I must go into browser inspector tools and override the default code to fit the website's needs.
If I needed margin or padding code, I had to refer to Bootstrap or the web class note to help me through the process. I also ask for help from the professor through the GitHub issue page to solve the issues. The professor had an open lab class for help and questions, which helped alleviate the struggles and stress throughout the project.

The responsive image was challenging because I needed to name all the images with proper naming conventions. In addition, the Visual Studio code does not auto-populate the images folder for the picture code. Copy and paste from “img src=” alt=” to the picture code. I overcame this by renaming all images, understanding “ img src=” alt=” functionally, and use to help the image folder access.

This project taught me a lot, including bootstrap code, resilience, and patience. I learned that I prefer using Bootstrap over HTML code. Bootstrap is a template instead of individual coding the website, and I get lost in all the small parts. I see the bigger picture of coding in Bootstrap.
For Resilience and patience, I need to break the code into more minor parts. Plan and analyze what website. If you get stuck, keep coding or ask questions about the code. This coding is a big puzzle, and puzzles take patience to build. I cannot rush through the code and must work slowly and steadily to complete the project.
